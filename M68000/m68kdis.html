<h1>CUG #430: M68KDIS Motorola 68000 family disassembler</h1>
<hr>

<p>Christopher G. Phillips (University of Texas at Austin) submits his
"m68kdis" disassembler for the <a href="http://mot-sps.com/sps/General/chips-nav.html">
Motorola 68000 family</a> of CPU
chips.  Disassemblers are system software that accepts a binary
executable as input and produces assembly language source as output.
Specifically, m68kdis supports the full instruction sets of the 68000,
68008, 68010, 68020, and 68030 CPU chips.  Additionally, m68kdis decodes
instructions for the 68851 Paged Memory Unit and the 68881/68882
Floating-Point Coprocessors.  The Motorola 68000 family chips power
millions of computers including the Macintosh, Atari, Amiga, and many
embedded CPU industrial applications.  The CUG Library edition of
m68kdis includes full source in C (no executables are provided).  The
m68kdis disassembler is immediately available as CUG volume #441.</p>

<p>Since m68kdis is portable, it is actually a cross-disassembler.  For
example, you can disassemble 68000 programs on a variety of host CPUs
from PCs to Unix machines.  Phillips provides a very clean Makefile
without any OS specific flags or options.  Additionally, he takes care
to avoid common pitfalls such as dependencies on the size of the int
data type.</p>

<h2><a name="detail">Using m68kdis</a></h2>

<p>In its basic operation, m68kdis reads in a single binary file (.o) and
produces an ASCII file containing an assembly language output (.s).
Ideally, the ".s" file could be run through your assembler and would
produce an ".o" file identical to the original.  Strictly speaking, a
disassembler is just a subset of functionality found in a debugger.  The
output of m68kdisk is divided into five distinct columns:  program
counter, file contents, label, instruction, and operands (see Fig. 1).</p>

<p>Programmers often use disassemblers in two specific modes of operation.
First, a disassembler may be used as a one-time operation to check the
operation of a compiler, the validity of an executable, the executable
startup code, or similar examination.  Second, the programmer may use a
sophisticated disassembler such as m68kdis in several successive
iterations.  In this cycle, the programmer uses his own judgement to
help separate blocks of instructions from blocks of data.  Then he
applies his knowledge or guesswork so that the next iteration provides
clearer output.  With persistence, a usable source file can result.</p>

<p>m68kdis supports this iterative method of use by providing options (see
Fig. 2) for the import of separate files containing external knowledge
of the input file.  For example, the "-i file" option accepts an input
ASCII file containing unsigned long integers that represent addresses
at which instructions are known to start.  Similarly, you can create
files of addresses where data is known to reside.  A small improvement
to m68kdis would allow ranges of addresses instead of just singleton
addresses in the file.</p>

<h2>Macintosh Support</h2>

<p>Although m68kdis works equally well against any target 68000 executable,
the author includes special additional support for Macintosh
executables. m68kdis understands enough of the executable to follow the
resource fork and dump it in a readable fashion.  This insures more
reliable output because determining the difference between instructions
and data is the prime job of a disassembler.</p>

<p>m68kdis supplies files containing Macintosh A-line instructions and
their OS equivalent entry point names.  More than 800 A-line
instructions can be decoded in this manner.  These entry points are
somewhat analogous to BIOS interrupt (INT) instructions used on
Intel-based MS-DOS PCs.</p>

<p>There is also a series of PERL scripts that perform post-processing on
the output of the disassembler.  PERL is not included in the CUG Library
distribution, but is widely available on the Internet.</p>

<h2>Documentation, Licensing, and Support</h2>

<p>Documentation for m68kdis consists primarily of a 5-page summary that
appears in Unix "man" page format.  As such, it primarily details
command line options and usage.  For insights into disassembly
algorithms, you'll need to follow the comments in the code.  For
details on the 68000 family instructions sets, please see the
section named "Further Reading" below.</p>

<p>Phillips includes an extremely generous license that extends the
permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its
documentation for any purpose and without fee.  The only restriction is
that his supplied copyright notice appear must in all copies of software
and that both the copyright notice and the permission notice appear in
supporting documentation.</p>

<p>Since m68kdis is freeware, there are no formal support options
available.  Support is thus neccessarily limited to email correspondence
regarding bugs and enhancement requests.</p>

<h2>Other 68000 Family Tools from CUG Library</h2>

CUG Library has assemblers, cross-assemblers, C compilers, and other
tools for use with the 68000 family of CPUs.  Each of these volumes is
available for only $4 per diskette.  Alternately, all of these titles
are included on the CUG Librayr CD-ROM.  Order using the form provided

<p>   * The CUG303 MC68K Disassembler is considerably less advanced than
M68KDIS.  For example, it does not include instruction-level support for
68010, 68020, 68851, or 68881/68882 chips.  Also MC68K omits Macintosh
support and the ability to declare regions of the file as data or code.</p>
