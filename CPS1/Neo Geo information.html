$3c000e $3c000f  Control R
    The format of this very important location is:  AAAA AAAA B??? CDDD

    A is most likely the video beam line, however from how it is used it
    doesn't seem to be a 0-255 direct map: the top bit is often masked out.

    I think the top bit of A is: (vblank OR irq2). sdodgeb loops waiting for
    it to be 1; zedblade heavily depends on it to work correctly.

    B is used together with A in one place, so most likely video beam position

    Maybe AAAAAAAAB is a 9-bit video line counter.
    It is tested individually in many cases (e.g. samsho3) so it might not be
    the low bit of the raster line.

    C is definitely a PAL/NTSC flag. Evidence:
        1) trally changes the position of the speed indicator depending on
           it (0 = lower 1 = higher).
        2) samsho3 sets a variable to 60 when the bit is 0 and 50 when
           it's 1. This is obviously the video refresh rate in Hz.
        3) samsho3 sets another variable to 256 or 307. This could be the
           total screen height (including vblank), or close to that.
           Some game (e.g. lstbld2, samsho3) do this (or similar):
           bclr    #$0, $3c000e.l
           when the bit is set, so 3c000e (whose function is unknown) has to
           be related
    D is unknown (counter of some kind, used in a couple of places).
        in blazstar, this controls the background speed in level 2.

IO addresses
$3c0000        Read/Write location in VRAM. 
$3c0002        Read/Write into VRAM
$3c0004        Value to increment VRAM address by (based on words)
$3c0006        Unknown, set vblank counter (?)
$3c0008        shadow adress for $3c0000.
$3c000a        shadow adress for $3c0002.

68k Addresses
$000000 $0fffff   Rom bank 1
$100000 $10ffff   Ram bank 1
$200000 $2fffff   Rom bank 2
$2ffff0 $2fffff   Neo Bankswitch Write
$400000 $401fff   Neogeo Palette Ram Read
$800000 $800fff   NeoGeo Memcard Read
    Memory card is a 2kb battery backed RAM.
    It is accessed thru $800000-$800FFF.
    Even bytes are always $FF
    Odd bytes are memcard data ($800 bytes)

$c00000 $c1ffff   System Bios Rom
$d00000 $d0ffff   64k battery backed SRAM

trally writes to 200000-200003 as well, probably looking for a serial
link both games write to 0000fe before writing to 200000. The two
things could be related. Sidekicks reads and writes to several
addresses in this range, using this for copy protection.

Z80 Addresses
    $0000  $7fff  Rom
    $8000  $bfff  Bank 5
    $c000  $dfff  Bank 6
    $e000  $efff  Bank 7
